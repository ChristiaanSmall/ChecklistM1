## Milestone 1
How to add an image from a url to swift app.

## What I Struggled With
- on how to add an image from a url.
- struggled on saving within the itemView

## Milestone 2
How to add Maps to an app
How to incorporate doubles type
How to make it so a maps location is based on lat and longitude

##What I struggled With
getting the map to update real time with long and latitude
app was lagging when image and map were together. Fixed it by making image load independently in imageView

## Milestone 3
- Successfully implemented a search feature, allowing users to search for specific locations within the application.
- Implemented functionality to update the coordinates dynamically as the map is moved, providing accurate location information to the users.
- Created a visually appealing thumbnail of the map in a separate view, enhancing the user experience.

##What I struggled With
Faced difficulties while implementing the search feature initially, but overcame them by conducting thorough testing and leveraging the provided PowerPoint materials to guide the implementation process.
Encountered occasional crashes related to image handling. Despite efforts to address the issue, such as verifying URL validity and implementing error handling, some crashes persisted.
